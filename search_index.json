["index.html", "How to make a histogram 1", " How to make a histogram 1 A histogram is a tool for representing the distribution of a set of data. The distribution of a set of data is the manner in which values in the set occur. This usually refers to the frequency (how often) or probability (how likely) values occur in different categories. A histogram is a graphical display of continuous data that are divided up into categories or classes or bins. The histogram uses bars, where the width of each bar covers the class or bin interval.
